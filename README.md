# SQL Crime Investigation Queries
This repository contains a collection of SQL queries crafted to solve a fictional crime investigation scenario. By analyzing data stored in relational tables, these queries aim to uncover critical evidence, identify suspects and witnesses, and reveal connections between individuals and events. The dataset includes tables such as `crime_scene_report`, `person`, `interview`, `drivers_license`, `get_fit_now_member`, `get_fit_now_check_in`, and `facebook_event_checkin`. 

This project demonstrates the practical application of SQL in problem-solving, particularly in the context of investigations and forensic analysis. By exploring these queries, users can improve their SQL skills, understand complex joins and subqueries, and appreciate how databases can aid in critical decision-making processes.

Each query is designed to answer specific investigative questions, utilizing advanced SQL techniques such as filtering, joins, subqueries, and pattern matching. The goal is to demonstrate how SQL can be effectively used in real-world problem-solving scenarios, particularly for forensic or investigative purposes.

### How to Use
**Setup the Database:** Ensure you have access to a relational database containing the necessary tables and data.

**Execute the Queries:** Copy and paste the SQL queries into your SQL client or database management tool to retrieve the required information.

**Analyze the Results:** Use the query outputs to draw connections, identify suspects or witnesses, and establish a timeline of events.
